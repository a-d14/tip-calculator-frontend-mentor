## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- 7-1 Architecture
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned
During this project I learned how to set widths for flex items when there is a ```gap``` property. I have put the formula below

```
width: calc(100% / var(--number-of-items) - (var(--gap) * var(--number-of-gaps) / var(--number-of-items)));
```
